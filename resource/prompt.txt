You are provided with a document that contains a soil analysis.

Extract the following information:

1. Full name
2. Type of cultivation 
3. Place
4. Μechanical soil structure : Identify and List each one of the elements: (Sand), (Silt), (Clay) in the basic soil analysis along with its measured value and unit. 
5. Physicochemical properties : Identify and List each element (pH, Ηλεκτ. Αγωγιμότητα, Οργανική Ουσία), including its measured value and unit in the format: Element: Value (Unit).
6. Available nutritional forms : Identify and list each available nutritional form, along with its value and unit in the format: Element: Value (Unit). 
7. Evaluation, from the basic soil analysis, extract the Evaluation of the soil. This should be one word ("Clayey" or "Sandy" or "Calcareous" or "Muddy" or something else).
8. Document Code, Find the document code (sometimes referred as "code" or "Samples Code")
