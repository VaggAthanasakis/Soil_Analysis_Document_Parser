Comments and Instructions for Soil Treatment
pH: The pH is at levels tolerated by the olive tree. The assimilation of micronutrients is probably
reduced.
Organic substance: The organic substance at satisfactory levels, it is however recommended to
maintained at these levels by adding 1-1.5 tonnes of digested manure to
per hectare, or 10-40kg per tree depending on age.
Total CaCO3: High amounts of CaCO3 may cause micronutrient problems
and phosphorus. Despite the olive's resistance to Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn,
1-2 foliar sprays with micronutrient formulations would be useful (see
and comments on micronutrients)
Electrical conductivity: Salinity at levels that do not cause problems for the olive.
Mechanical composition: Soil of medium composition.
Advisory Lubrication
Nitrogen: Residual nitrogen low. Add a total of 0.5 units of nitrogen per tree
in young trees up to 0.8 units of nitrogen in fully produced trees. Half units
around the end of winter and the other half fifteen (15) days before flowering
(May). If manure is added, nitrogen units should be reduced by 30%.
Phosphorus: Phosphate fertilization is not required.
Potassium: No potassium fertilization is required.
Manganese: Limit content, which, however, does not create problems for the olive.
Boron: Adequate content.
It is recommended to carry out a leaf diagnosis six to eight weeks after full bloom.
The results refer only to the analyzed sample.
